## Description

This project is a task management web application developed with React and Vite.

Key features that will be used for testing demonstrations include:

- User authentication
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Global state management
- API calls (simulated with json-server)
- Conditional rendering and error handling

Through this project, students will gain hands-on experience in writing effective tests, using mocks, and simulating user interactions, all within the context of a real and functional React application.

## Main Features

- User authentication
- CRUD for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Intuitive and responsive user interface
- Mock API with json-server for local development
